# User Merged PRs Logic Verification

## Issue #4 Verification

This document confirms the verification of issue #4: "[fix]: confirm that you checking if the user's PRs were merged not the user merged PRs"

## Current Logic Analysis

The current implementation in `src/lib/github.ts` (lines 194-196) correctly implements the required logic:

```typescript
// Check if this is the target user's PR
if (pr.user?.login === username) {
  userMergedPRs++;
}
```

## Verification Results

✅ **LOGIC IS CORRECT** - The current implementation properly counts:

1. **PRs authored by the user** (`pr.user.login === username`)
2. **That were merged** (filtered by `pr.merged_at` being not null)
3. **Within the specified date range** (filtered by date comparison)

## What the Logic Does NOT Do

❌ The logic does NOT count PRs that the user personally merged (which would be `pr.merged_by?.login === username`)

## Form Text Verification

The form correctly displays: "You personally authored ≥5 merged PRs across the repo/org in the last 90 days."

This matches exactly what the current logic implements.

## Conclusion

**No code changes are required.** The current logic correctly identifies PRs authored by the user that were merged, which is exactly what was requested in the issue.

The statistic represents "PRs authored by the user that were merged" NOT "PRs the user personally merged."
